# developing food text classification system

This workshop is based on developing a web-based machine learning system for simple text
classification. The following steps will show you how to set up a Node js server to run the core system of
the machine learning (fasttext tool for text classification) on input from a user.
 


## In first version 
Here I was using Windows 10 so I needed to download the Virtual Box and use Ubuntu for this workshop.
to run the first version of the system you follow the following steps:

1. Download npm:
```bash
sudo apt install npm
```
2. Create and open project folder:
```bash
mkdir [your choice name]
 ```
3. Initialize requirements: 
```bash
npm init -y 
 ```
4. Add index.html,index.js and train.txt in the same folder.

5. Install the Node.js sandbox for the Machine learning algorithm (fasttext): 
```bash
npm install nodefasttext --save
 ```   
6. Install Express: 
```bash
npm install express --save
 ```
7. Install some cors issues:
```bash
npm install cors --save
 ```
8. Now if you want to get this sandbox up and running pretty quick you go ahead and use my
HTML and J's files (provided on this URL) and once you have done. 

9. Run index.js: 
```bash
node index.js
 ```
After that i upload all files to GitHub 
```bash
git init
git remote add origin repositorylink
git status
git commit -m "first commit"
git push 
 ```
finally, create first release 0.1.
